Okashi is an Joke App, It fetches jokes from internet and displays them on the App in an elegant way. App Employs web-scrapping on client-side to avoid intermediate server for hosting API. All the jokes are fetched from App on Demand. 

This gives a good example of developing an Server-Less API Which can cut down cost. Although employing client-side API communication may expose the developer API, although it can be avoided by taking further actions.
